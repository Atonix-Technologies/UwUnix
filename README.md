[Verse 1: Double K]
Old English 800, or the Genuine Draft
Living the High Life but Steel Reserved when it's bad
You can say I have a problem man (but) I say they help me solve 'em
Drinking 40s wit' my nigga dog and all the dudes who bought 'em
It seems I have evolved in to this party animal
I be drunk and talking shit, while you pricks take it light
Get off the mic and let me babble 'bout the days of old
When I was young ya didn't know ice teas could be so cold
All I knew was colors..and that stuff my mom made
Nowadays I drink just like it's the purple Kool Aid
Bro go easy on the ice and add a little more Smirnoff
So by the time I reach the bottom I can be clear off
Don't think it's 'bout to end I say it's 'bout to begin
Take off my shirt, show my belly, offend a few of my friends
And you can ask Kid Lex we be doing the most
On Melrose with a 5th in hand, yelling at hoes
And ain't getting no play from the ladies who pass
Shit, we're drunk, breath stinking without a inch of class
And that's alright with me, 'cause baby I'm the Big Mac
{Went over to McDonald's}, I'm 'bout to cop a fat sack
'Cause niggas be like "Every time I see you K, you drunk."
Remarks like that will get 'em judged as a punk
You ain't Crunk, buddy I'll take your latest hip-hop money
Divide it wit' my friends so we can all get funny
Keep your thoughts to yourself 'cause on the real cousin', I'm buzzing
Tell your peoples I'm a motherfucker case they thought I wasn't
Mom said: "Chill out..or watch your life go down"
Saw what happened to a friend, well it won't happen again
And I promise: most functional, this bottle here's my petrol
Force field for the unreal...I got no time to kill
Plus..the first time I took a nip I didn't sip
Couple of wine coolers took exactly what it was
What a buzz! Had the young Double stone-knocked-out
Like a sucker who stepped and posed a threat when I went
You can call me what you want: A damn drunk or a fool
But I'm the first to pass out and make the shit look cool
Incidents like that are few like the brew Zima or Tequiza
That's for women somebody pass the gin and Powerade
Yo it's also time to drink..get off the track
I'ma chill with my buddies and toss a few back...
